            Just like you, we are pawrents to a very special furkid, Simba, a
            red Shiba inu. Coming from a family of bakers, we have developed a
            very special pet friendly cake recipe with the ingredients we trust
            for Simba. Seeing how he loves it so much, we decided to share it
            among close friends then all the other furkids too.

            What makes our cakes different?

            <p>
              Started off as bakers (for humans), we construct our cakes the
              best way we know… similarly to a normal cake, our pet cakes have
              got layers of cake with protein layers in between. You’ll be able
              to see the beautiful layers of the cake when you cut it. Our
              soy-cream cheese frosting is absolutely delicious too.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Petissier, we aim to produce cakes that will be memorable to
              both pets and humans. We hope to create special designs which are
              personal to your furkid’s celebration.
            </p>

              Every pet is special… that floppy ear, that quirky birthmark and
              that spunky personality. We are able to customise your pet’s
              pawtrait onto the cake to show how special your pet is.

            We are super grateful to all of our lovely customer’s support. Every
            cake and every order is a milestone to us. We are always excited
            when you guys send us photos and tell us how much your pooch enjoyed
            themselves. We would love to serve smiles more than anything!

            Another recent milestone would be that we are featured in Tatler
            Best of Singapore list 2022. We couldn’t be more proud and would
            like to extend our gratitude to our supportive customers. We can
            only make it this far because of YOU! We look forward to serving
            more smiles and meeting more of you.
